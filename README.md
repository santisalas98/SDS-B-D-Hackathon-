# SDS-B-D-Hackathon-

This script shows the work done for the SDS - Business &amp; Decision Hackathon (2023). The obejective of the hackathon was to develop a model to predict whether or not a patient is likely to have a stroke or not. For this purpose, we ended up using the XGBoost library, with cross validation and fine-tuning. 

The model was develop over a time spam of 24 hours, and it could be further refined, but it is a good first step to understand the classification of unbalanced data and the trade-off between accuracy and recall. The result generalized well, and the model ended up second in the competition. 

We also decided to develop an app that would tell users their probability of having a stroke. We believed that this was an useful way of raising awareness, especially considering that up to 90% of strokes could be prevented. This app is just a very initial draft, as due to the tiem constraints of the competition we were more focus on finding the best possible model.
